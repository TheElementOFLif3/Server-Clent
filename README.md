# Server-Clent
Server and Cliet


I created an application for adding two numbers. The addition operation itself needs to take place on the server, which accepts the two additions and delivers the result. Therefore, it is necessary that the solution contains two components: server and client.

Within the client application, the user needs to be able to enter two numbers using the Scanner class. Values need to be placed inside variables and then sent to the server part of the application. Values can be sent together or separately. After accepting the value, the server should add the passed numbers and deliver the total to the client. The obtained total must be displayed on the client at the output.
